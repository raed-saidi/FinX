## 📊 Slide 2: The Problem

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  THE PROBLEM                                   │
│                                                │
│  ❌ Retail investors lack sophisticated tools  │
│                                                │
│  ❌ Financial markets are volatile & complex   │
│                                                │
│  ❌ Professional quant strategies are          │
│     exclusive to hedge funds                   │
│                                                │
│  ❌ Existing platforms provide basic charts    │
│     but NO predictive insights                 │
│                                                │
│  💡 Gap: Accessible AI-driven predictions      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"75% of retail investors struggle with timing decisions. They see charts but get no predictive guidance. Meanwhile, hedge funds use machine learning to gain 5-10% alpha. We're bridging this gap."

## 📝 BONUS: Anticipated Q&A

**Q1: "How do you prevent overfitting with 94 features?"**
**A:** "Great question! We use L1/L2 regularization in XGBoost, walk-forward validation that simulates real deployment, and we've tested on 4 years of unseen data (2021-2024). Our test Sharpe ratio of 5.47 proves generalization."

**Q2: "What if your predictions are wrong?"**
**A:** "We display confidence scores with every prediction. When confidence is low (<50%), we recommend caution. We also show historical accuracy per asset so users can judge for themselves. Transparency is key."

**Q3: "How is this different from Robinhood or Webull?"**
**A:** "Those platforms show you charts and news. Odyssey PREDICTS where stocks are going with 77-80% accuracy and explains WHY. It's like having a quant analyst in your pocket."

**Q4: "Can this scale to millions of users?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. We're on Google Cloud Run, which auto-scales serverless containers. Our prediction latency is 87ms, so we can handle 1,200 predictions per second per instance. Add more instances as needed."

**Q5: "What about regulatory compliance?"**
**A:** "We're currently for educational purposes and paper trading only. Before real-money trading, we'll pursue SEC registration or partner with licensed brokers like Alpaca (which we already integrate)."

**Q6: "How accurate is 77% really?"**
**A:** "In finance, 77% directional accuracy is exceptional. A coin flip is 50%. Professional traders celebrate 60%. At 77%, compounded over hundreds of trades, you generate significant alpha."

**Q7: "Why not use deep learning instead of XGBoost?"**
**A:** "We tested LSTMs - they gave us 2.87 Sharpe vs XGBoost's 5.06. Financial data has high noise-to-signal ratio. XGBoost's regularization and interpretability make it superior for this problem. Plus, 10ms inference vs 200ms for neural nets."

**Q8: "What's your biggest challenge?"**
**A:** "Honestly? Data quality and market regime shifts. A model trained on 2010-2020 data may struggle with 2025's AI-driven volatility. That's why we monitor drift and retrain quarterly."
